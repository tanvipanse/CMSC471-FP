  <h2>Hot Zones: Wildfire Risk Map</h2>
  <p>Year by year, the United States gets plagued by fires. To be more specific, between the years of 1992 and 2015, the US was riddled with over 1.5 million wildfires, <br> but their impact varied dramatically based on location. This series of visualizations is meant to allow users to explore the <em>when</em>, <em>where</em>, and primarily the <strong>why</strong> of American wildfires.
  <br><br><br><strong><em>The big picture: the U.S. fire landscape.</em></strong> <br><br> As you drag the slider on the bottom, allow the map to take you through the years, and observe the fire concentrations as they occur. <br> Below the map is a legend, which describes the specifics of how color and circle size demonstrate the severity (acres burned) of the fire. <br>Hovering over each circle draws in a tooltip, explaining the when, where, and how of each fire. </p>

  Now that you’ve had the opportunity to play with the map, we’d like to call something to your attention (if you haven’t already noticed it). <br><br> Wildfires are not random. <br><br> After some examination, you’ll quickly begin to notice crucial patterns.
  <p>The largest, most severe fires frequently blaze in the west. The southeast sees fires as well, but they are much smaller, and highly concentrated. <br>In certain years, we see particular states light up–for example, observe Oregon in 2012. You’ll notice large red and black circles along the southeastern border. </p>
  <p>We’ve investigated size, so let’s move on to the cause–what is causing these wildfires to occur? <br><br>Underneath, we have a dynamic bar chart that reveals the major causes of fires each year. It is updated as the map animation is paused on a certain year. <br> <strong>Hit play,</strong> and watch the animation unfold 3 decades worth of wildfires across the country. <em>Do you notice any alarming trends?</em></p>

  </div>    
  <p>As you pause on a year, you can <strong>click on any cause</strong> that piques your interest to reveal a <strong>state-by-state heat map</strong> that shows how many fires of that particular cause occurred in that year.<br> Darker colors represent high fire counts, as shown in the key on the left. </p>
  <div id="heatmap-container" style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px;">
    <h3>Heatmap by Cause and State</h3>

  This final visualization is truly meant to tie the story together. The map and bar chart together paint an easily digestible view of the problem. 
  <br> But understanding the problem is <em>only the first step</em>. We use this heatmap to demonstrate where targeted interventions can make the biggest difference.
  <br><br>The viewpoint now shifts from purely asking what happened, to understanding where to ask. This is information that could benefit policymakers and climate activists<br> in their journey to mitigate the wildfires that blaze across the country. The addition of this feature is important as a tool to allow support for <em>decision making</em> and <strong>action.</strong>
